# Getting started with writing a GuiBot

## Installation of the newest version

```commandline
pip install git+https://github.com/Telcrome/guibot_client
```

## Notes

- Take a look at the template for writing your own bot.
- We recommend using the ``pythonw.exe`` interpreter, because it does not open the console.
  - CAUTION: pythonw will abort silently if anything is printed to the cmd using the pretty print module pprint
